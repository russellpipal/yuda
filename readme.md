### Yuda

## Yuda is currently a work in progress. I hope to have it deployed soon.

Yuda is a web application that allows users to make and track goals.

Users designate a goal with a deadline, and may allow other users to view goals.

Once a goal has been submitted, it cannot be altered or deleted. This is the primary motivator to finish goals.

The project uses Node.js, AngularJS, Express, PostgreSQL, and Angular Material.

Run "npm start" to start server. Requires PostgreSQL to be running with a database named 'yuda'. All tables will be generated during initilization.
